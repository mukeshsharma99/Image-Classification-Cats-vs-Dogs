# 🐾 Image Classification — Cats vs Dogs   

This project focuses on binary image classification to differentiate between **cats** and **dogs** using supervised learning.    

## 📌 Overview
- **Goal:** Classify images as either a cat or a dog.
- **Dataset:** Labeled images of cats and dogs. 
- **Approach:** 
  - Extract relevant features from images.
  - Build and train a binary classifier.
  - Evaluate performance using standard metrics.

## ✅ Tasks
- **Feature Extraction:** Capture key visual features for accurate classification.
- **Model Training:** Develop a reliable binary classifier.
- **Evaluation:** Measure accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and analyze the confusion matrix.

## 🚀 Result
A well-trained model that can accurately predict whether an image shows a **cat** or a **dog**, with clear evaluation reports.
